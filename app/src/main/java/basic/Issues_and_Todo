Todo:
- Make an adult class that has an evolve method that calls the die method
- Move the catchup functionality from the Pet to the Model
- Inventory menu
- Pet state changes
- Add saving whenever the play activity is interrupted
- Add loading whenever it starts back up

Issues:


Ideas:
- Let each stage of a pet's life affect the longevity of the rest of the stages. For example: There
  might be one egg type that makes all the rest of the stages last twice as long as they would if
  they were raised from a normal egg. Can be achieved with a multiplier in the pet savefile that is
  affected by all the different stages of its life.
