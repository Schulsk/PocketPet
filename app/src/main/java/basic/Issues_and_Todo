Todo:
- Make Button subclasses for all the different use cases I have, like CloseButton, InventorySlotButton etc.
- Check the locks in the controller objects. I think they are not being locked when they should.
- I think I should consider getting rid of the Controller class. It seems to have been a bad idea
  based on my lack of understanding the MVC structure but still trying to adhere to it.
- Make an adult class that has an evolve method that calls the die method
- Move the catchup functionality from the Pet to the Model
- Inventory menu
- Pet state changes
- Add saving whenever the play activity is interrupted
- Add loading whenever it starts back up

Issues:
- Eggs can lay eggs
- When the pet slot in the model is updated the viewupdater needs to be told, or I have to
  figure out another clever way to get it to update whenever things happen.

Ideas:
- Could do an envelope class for the Pets so that pets can evolve on their own. Not sure.
- If I make an egg-shop that both buys and sells eggs, I could make events that happen when you sell
  specific eggs. These events could give you access to certain things like equipment and other shops
  etc. for instance could you try to sell an egg that is of the fossil type. Then the shop owner
  would tell you that he knows someone that might be very interested in that egg (Here is room for
  another idea too, where he makes a date with the guy and tells you to come back at a specific
  day/time. If you fail to meet, you have to make a new date and try again.) He refers you, and you
  unlock either a permanent access to the character, or you get a new item in the shop.
- Maybe I should have just kept all stats in a hashmap, in stead of reassigning them to variables?
  Perhaps not, The issue I'd meet then would be the different data types
- Let each stage of a pet's life affect the longevity of the rest of the stages. For example: There
  might be one egg type that makes all the rest of the stages last twice as long as they would if
  they were raised from a normal egg. Can be achieved with a multiplier in the pet savefile that is
  affected by all the different stages of its life.
- Cloning machine. Buy in the shop, and clone your pet into an egg.
